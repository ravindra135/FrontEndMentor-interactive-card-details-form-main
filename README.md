## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- JS

### What I learned

There are so many things I have Learned while building this project, especially the JS.

In this project you will find, 1 Markup File, 2 CSS files, and 1 JS file.

Go through the code, and let know the suggestions in Feedback section.

***Had Fun*** while building this Project:

- Responsive Design;

  - Design needs to be changed for row to column while switching between Desktop to Mobile View; And Cards Size needs to be adjusted, along with *font-size* to make the text responsive also.
  - Added Transition, which makes the switching or flexing more fluent and decent.

- The Javascript;

  - Writing the Custom Validation part.
  - Printing the Errors.

**Note: Some parts of the JS codes are length, consider improving them. As being a begginer I tried all of them myself;**

### Continued development

The Development will be continued as, the some part of challenge is incomplete indeed.

  - Border Color Change to Gradient, on Focus;
  - Updating Card Details in Real Time from input;

## Acknowledgments

I would really thank you [KEVIN POWELL](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob), for his wonderfull suggestion on giving a shot to Frontend Mentor. I think it worked for me. As, being a Backend Developer I wanted to go for Full-Stack so, I really need a strong hold on Advanced CSS. Frontend Mentor is really good to have a  realtime practice session on-the-go.
